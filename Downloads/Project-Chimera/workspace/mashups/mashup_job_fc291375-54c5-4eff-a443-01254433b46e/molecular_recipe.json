The vocal molecules will be layered with harmonic chords to build tension, while rhythmic molecules will drive the energy. The climax will feature a complex molecular crescendo with rising bass drops and melodic hooks, then smoothly resolve into a textured, resonant outro that leaves a lasting emotional imprint.",
