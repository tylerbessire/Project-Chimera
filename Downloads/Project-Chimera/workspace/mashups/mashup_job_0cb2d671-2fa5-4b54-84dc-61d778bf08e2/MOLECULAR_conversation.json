The concept requires implementing granular synthesis at sub-millisecond resolution, spectral morphing with formant manipulation, and multi-dimensional harmonic stacking. The 'atomic storm' approach necessitates real-time spectral analysis, phase-coherent processing, and molecular-level timing control. This is technically achievable but requires maximum processing headroom and precision alignment algorithms.",
