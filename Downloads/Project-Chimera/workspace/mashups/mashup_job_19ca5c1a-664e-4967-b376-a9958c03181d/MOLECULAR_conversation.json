    "message": "MOLECULAR VISION: Unleash a chaos of sonic molecules by dissecting every syllable, fragmenting words into atomic phonemes, and reassembling them into a warp-speed vortex of vocal distortion. Fuse vibrato atoms with synthetic formants, warp pitch molecules mid-sentence, and interleave delay particles to create an ever-shifting vocal landscape that defies natural boundaries. Generate impossible harmonic resonance through molecular stacking, achieving layered universes of vocal parity that collide and intertwine. Implant rhythmic chopping at the atomic level, detonating syllable clusters into chaotic loop galaxies, then reconstruct phrases with overlapping atomic fragments for a deafening tapestry of molecular voice assault.",
