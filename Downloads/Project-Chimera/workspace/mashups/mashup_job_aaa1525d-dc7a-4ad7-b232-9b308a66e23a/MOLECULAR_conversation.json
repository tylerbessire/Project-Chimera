Granular synthesis will pulverize syllables into grains as short as 10ms, randomized in time and frequency, then reassembled via PSOLA with pitch-synchronous overlap for seamless chaos. Formant morphing will leap across spectrums employing LPC matrices at 0.01 semitone accuracy\u2014transforming vocal identities mid-shard.

    "message": "MOLECULAR ENGINEERING: Luna's molecular vision demands extreme precision in spectral manipulation with sub-millisecond timing accuracy. The FFT-based syllable isolation at 24-bit/44.1kHz with 10ms boundary detection is technically sound but requires 4x oversampling during processing to prevent aliasing artifacts. The granular synthesis approach with 10ms grains and PSOLA reconstruction will create the desired chaos while maintaining spectral integrity. LPC formant morphing at 0.01 semitone resolution is achievable with proper coefficient interpolation. The delay network architecture with 1-500ms feedback loops requires careful gain staging to prevent runaway feedback while maintaining harmonic chaos.",
